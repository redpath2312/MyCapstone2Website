    <h1 id="blog-title">2 Year Dev Blog Story</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>As a bit of a marker at 2 years since starting to learn “to be a dev” I had reflected on my journey in terms of how far I’d come, what I’d achieved, what I’d been through, my goals for the coming year and written this all down in below blog to tell a bit of a story. I hope this gives a bit of a transparent honest, and realistic view of what it is like to start trying to pick up something completely new and potentially career changing amidst the challenges life gives us. It also took a bit of time to write and is now going beyond 2 years and will perhaps keep that going as on ongoing review/blog.</p>
    <p>To start I think it is interesting to consider the why and what triggered me to start learning dev in the first place and to do that I need to go back to around 2005.</p>

    <h2>Paperwork</h2>
    <p>Not long after Uni I got my first “proper job” at an IT Service Desk that supported various military bases by being a single contact centre to call. It was the start of a longer-term migration so took a while initially for things to get busy so there would often be gaps in between calls. You weren’t allowed phones in the office although at that point in time it was only the early stages of WAP network anyway before fancier smart phones came out a few years later. We got creative in passing the time, and it was there I even learned to play poker when it was really quiet. I’m still not sure who suggested it but when we were at our desks, we devised “Paper Battleships”. We drew out the grids on a piece of paper each, (later we upgraded our OS to graph paper) and drew where we wanted the ships and played. It was great as if you got a call, you could easily pause the game. After a few games, between the few of us we thought of ways to change it up a bit. I can’t take credit for all of the initial ideas, but soon had a ranking system that you went up if you won (We had a card on our desk with all the military ranks which was useful). We also had an island with a commander who also had an escape dinghy. I started to go a bit crazy and nukes, radar, anti-air turrets etc followed. I then even made other Land and Air variants, with the land variant a bit inspired by UT2004 and Halo multiplayer games with bases and power cores. The air variant was well…forgettable as I don’t remember much about it apart from ambiguous odd shapes. Eventually things got busier on the day shifts, and sometime after that I moved to nights for the money and though there would be periods of quiet again, I tended to pass the time with films that I’d burned to CD/DVD or got from Netflix back when they sent you DVDs in the post (A max of like 3 at a time!). However, those great times playing a souped-up Paper Battleships always stuck with me and I guess didn’t really realise it but I kind of had, with help from others, designed a game.</p>

    <h2>May Day</h2>
    <p>Fast forward to around May 2022, after some earlier technical roles, I’d been now working as a Project Manager for Sky Bet primarily around Slot Games content for many years, and in need of something new to energise me. There were some workstreams on Innovation which were intriguing me, and lots of interest in VR, and trying to do something that would personalise the experience more on our sites and having a place for people to play games with each other. Me and one of my colleagues who will call Mr Duck would occasionally catch up and talk about cool ideas that we could do with the site and social games that could be introduced particularly if we made something in VR. Somehow, we landed on the idea of doing Battleships in VR as I already knew in my head the spin I could give on the game if we did make it. So, then what if I said we went onto make it, and it was a great success? Well, that’s not what happened, so sorry but this isn’t one of those fairy tales. However, those conversations with Mr Duck sparked something that made me realise a very clear fact. I don’t know how to make games. But… I really wanted to know, so that we might be able to build it. Plus, I was conscious I’d been spending/wasting a lot of time playing games and thought this could be more productive so I started doing a bit of googling…</p>

    <h2>Getting things moving</h2>
    <p>After a bit of searching on how to make games it was clear the most popular tools to do so were Unity and Unreal Engine and as I had no real coding experience apart from a little at Uni. I quickly arrived at choosing Unity with C# as it seemed to be more suitable for beginners starting out as opposed to Unreal Engine and C++. I tried out a few Unity Lego type minigames from the main Unity website to have a play with to get a bit of a feel, though was quite overwhelming so needed to start a bit from the basics. I came across a YouTube video of 2-hour tutorial of making a basic platformer, to start from scratch with something. I remember that also being very overwhelming, however it was also extremely rewarding even just making the most basic thing happen through programming like getting an object to move or jump. Not long after this I was thinking how I could start more of structured learning when I had a bit of a breakthrough realisation…We have Udemy Business for FREE at work, (an online learning tool) which just kickstarted EVERYTHNG.</p>
    
    <h2>In the beginning there was Udemy</h2>
    <p> After searching for an appropriate beginner course that would teach me the basics of Unity and C#, I arrived at one that would teach me how to build a little 2D Space Shooter game and a 3D First Person Sci Fi Scene. I loved the format of the course and Udemy in general straight away for the bitesize chunks of modules and challenges to take me through step by step, building something. After a few weeks I had a little demo of it on my phone using the nice Unity Cross Platform Build support. In a month and half around mid-July 2022 I’d completed the course which was a really proud moment and meant I could then switch focus on actually trying to build something more on my own. I already had another game idea to bring to life thanks to my old school friends and memories that go way, way back to possibly the very end of the last century when we were still in Secondary School.</p>
   
    <h2>Back in 1999</h2>
    <p> I was quite geeky back in school, but my friend took it to another level by managing to program things on a calculator. Yes, a calculator. Granted this was a Scientific calculator, but still find it impressive that he managed to make a few games and even something that resembled Windows. (And probably still better than Vista) I recall 3 – A guy chasing you around and trying to avoid dying, Need for Speed Casio edition (Unofficial), but the crowning jewel had to be Drunk Horse Racing. With all these you had to have a good imagination to fill in the blanks with the graphics but it was essentially 4 letters, each a “horse” A, B, C, D racing across the screen and one of them was “drunk” and effectively didn’t go in a straight line and sometimes went into the “crowd”. If there was ever a perfect game that needed to be made into a retro pixel art SNES style version and also be an ideal starter game to try out with, that could be built upon it was this.</p>
   
    <h2>And we’re off</h2>
    <p>With some basic knowledge now under my belt and fresh inspiration I started making a prototype of a horse racing game. I realised quickly that I didn’t know pixel art, I was never very good at art and there wasn’t anything that suitable for free but learnt some real basics of sprite creation and knocked up 4 horses (not like that) and I soon had 4 racing across the screen. After a month I had a sort of playable prototype with a UI and several features like stamina, health and power ups and stats. However, as I was still a beginner, it showed in the code and was becoming almost unworkable to keep tweaking it as I had to keep maintaining 4 different horse scripts with horribly connected methods and systems. It was perhaps a natural point to pause anyway and do more learning but an opportunity arose at work to get quite involved in an interesting VR innovation project which had gained traction and which seemed perfect to do with Unity.</p>
        
    <h2>VR</h2>
    <p>This was when things got really fun and creative. Me and a few people including Mr Duck came together to work on an idea to make a social free betting like space but in VR where you could play games and have content such as football streams with an end goal of integrating betting. With help from Mr Duck, and by finding another Udemy course that covered how to get a Multiplayer VR prototype he basically provided an initial test scene to build from. By referring to the VR course I was then able to really start having fun in creating mini little interactable features and games and get some good coding and Unity experience. It turned into a mini project where I was half PM, half dev on it which was perfect. We even got some user research going and did some demos at internal talks and events and it was at an event I met another dev who I’ll refer to as Mr Dude who immediately wanted to get involved. We developed the prototype further and I was able to get some great experience and learning time in with Mr Dude who was an experienced dev. It culminated in a showcase to senior leadership which was rather proud of as we’d included lots of concepts and minigames…incidentally with ducks, and a new game I’d invented called “Chuckball”. All the research and discussions though uncovered a lot of challenges with VR and we were going to have to go in a more accessible mobile/web 3D direction. However, as I’d been pretty engrossed for a while in the excitement of learning dev, and was often doing the VR stuff and other game dev learning outside of work, unbeknown to me this had been having a negative and grinding impact on my home life and my relationship with my partner.</p>
    
    <h2>Rollercoasters</h2>
    <p> In Autumn 2022 I’d been with my girlfriend Jade just over 3 years at that point. She moved in to my house at the start of lockdown (the first one) when we were told to “Stay at Home, Protect the NHS and Save Lives”. Things were actually great for us in lockdown, as Jade had a bit of furlough time in gorgeous weather and we eventually got 2 kittens as I was indefinitely working from home. Coming out of the various lockdowns we then appreciated the things we could do as couples like going for dinner, (remember “eat out to help out”!), cinema, and holidays. The first couple of years I’d say there were no hiccups really and even despite the pandemic managed to have some amazing holidays in Wales, and Northumberland and then when flights opened up again Cyprus. Other general things like theme parks became possible and since Jade was terrified of big rollercoasters, I remember starting to look at which type of rollercoasters she’d be comfortable on. (This was back in early summer 2021) I downloaded Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 for the Switch to get a feel for things for her. After also coming across some videos online I found there even more realistic Rollercoaster simulation games. I loved Rollercoaster Tycoon when I was in my teens so was really interested in trying out a modern version. Well, that modern version was Planet Coaster, and once I installed it on my PC it triggered a bit of an addiction. Jade always knew I was a bit of a gamer, and it was my chill thing a bit more than lots of TV (I can do that too though!) though generally I’d been more casually playing Switch in the same room than in my office on the PC playing games there. Though Planet Coaster was the game I put most hours into, there were a few other games I got into on the PC as I’d shifted now a quite a bit to PC from Switch. Eventually though as I started getting more intrigued about how to make games, I thought I would be more productive with my time, and there the journey started with the Dev and learning, and VR. However, this was still essentially being isolated away in my home office a lot. We did still of course have our own time, and we had another holiday in Cuba too in the summer, but financially this stretched us a bit too much and when we came back from that we weren’t able to do so many of the usual nice things together and before we knew it summer was over. Jade seemed to have loads of other stressful things hitting her at once, and coupling that with my continued time focussing on dev things gradually ground our relationship down to a breaking point. Something had to change, but it was looking like it was a little too late. </p>

    <h2>Winter is coming</h2>
    <p>It was approaching winter 2022, and it was evident I need to get a better routine at home and have more time together with Jade. I’d also taken up Padel tennis as well, so health and fitness were also a bit of a balance. For a long time, I’ve generally played football once a week after work, on and off with the gym as well for weights. I had my 40th coming up which was taking a bit of planning and right around Christmas too. Most weekends were also mostly filled up with doing stuff with family. So, the VR and dev work started to take a bit of a back seat and would try and have more TV time with Jade on an evening. Fortunately, the VR stuff was winding down at work anyway for now and would look to reboot that with a general 3D concept in the new year. I had begun another Udemy course which was helping with general dev learning which I would still eventually finish and have a few mini prototype games to show for it but this wasn’t as crammed and focussed as some of my earlier dev time. Generally, we were talking and having a bit more time together but despite that, having a fun group birthday shindig away, and the usual family Christmas, things were just not right and Jade was not in a good place so there wasn’t an easy fix. Then at the worst time possible she then got some bad family news which was going to mean even more stress and her having to look after her mum for a short time in the new year.
    </p>
    <h2>We were on a break</h2>
    <p>It really wasn’t the best start to 2023, for the first few weeks Jade had to be at her mums quite a bit and then look after her following an op so it was difficult for us to focus on well…us. Dev wise at work I was getting going with a new prototype with Mr Dude that would eventually become a 3D cross platform stadium themed multiplayer space to explore betting and personalised features. I generally just did this in work time though and in my spare time working my way through a very good game dev course. Over the coming weeks and few months, I’d learnt how to build a simple Tower Defence game and also a Zombie FPS, which I’d later spend a bit of time on getting some nice assets in and theming the level around a farm. I even recorded a bit of a title theme for Zombie Farm on my keyboard but became one of those not quite finished prototypes but the intent was there. This was all a bit trivial at the time though as needed to sort out the home life. Once Jade came back after looking after her mum, it wasn’t long before we realised that we still hadn’t managed to fix anything and despite trying to have a nice Valentines together, the day after with a long talk we actually pretty much knew we were breaking up. Jade then went back to her mums shortly after. However, without dwelling too much more on this, the next month or two was pretty awful, with her all but moved out save a few things still to collect. To quote Ross from Friends “We were on a break!”  But after lots of talking and oddly a park walk to avoid packing the rest of the things up, we suddenly seemed to turn a corner and gave us hope to start again. Over the next few weeks, we essentially started dating again and by Easter she was moved in back properly. All was good again and I’d even managed to finish the Udemy course too.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Cut Scenes…end of Year 1</h2>
    <p>What happens when you finish a Udemy course? Well, a good idea is probably to practice what you’ve learnt but I seemed jump into another one again as kind of annoyingly the very first course I completed now was showing as only about half done. What the hell? It had been updated! However, it now some cool new cinematic tutorials for how to create cut scenes which I did want to learn so I could try them out with Zombie Farm. I progressed through this and finished the cinematics section but never really revisited Zombie Farm much. I also did want to look at creating an inventory in it, but that was still something I hadn’t yet covered through the courses, but quite near the top of things I wanted to learn. By now this was getting into later parts of Spring. I had a long overdue holiday with Jade in Majorca which helped with getting things back on track, and in June I had a nice break with my sister in Berlin for her 50th. At work our cross-platform prototype had really come on and was still working with Mr Dude on this as well as other 3rd parties at work to really explore the possibilities. We’d even planned in some more research. I even by using some learning budget joined a game dev conference which had quite a few interesting topics and tips. Suddenly I’m at my 1-year marker since starting learn dev, and if I look back at the key highlights and lowlights it was a crazy year.</p>

        <li>A 3D Cross platform work prototype in progress.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Web Dev</h2>
    
    <p>As I’d been doing game dev a year, and still had the same thirst for it, I thought I might at some point need to be able to have a bit of a website and a place to share any games. But bigger than that, that it was real ambition to try and see if I could make a career switch into dev but where I work it’s a lot more about web development, unless you get into developing slot games like Mr Dude does, but I’d never really fancied doing that. I realised there would be a lot more opportunity for experience, as well as it being really useful if I started learning the basics of web development and have more awareness of the technologies that dev’s use these days. I’d then also know how to knock up a website and start a portfolio. I had way back in the past learnt basics of html so it wouldn’t be too scary to start it. I arrived at yet another Udemy course that was Complete Full Stack Web Development which seemed to cover all the main technologies that would be used at work. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, DB’s, Node, Authentication, React, Git, and lots of other things too like Web3.0 and blockchain. It was a huge course but would be beneficial and could then look at getting mentoring to accompany it. The year 2 journey began.</p>
    
    <h2>Not Doing an RPG</h2>
    <p>I was underway with learning Web Dev, and trying to utilise times in the morning before work to concentrate on it. This was good for home life and yet still maximising good focus time available outside of work. That’s not to say I’d stopped completely on game dev. For a while I’d been really curious and itching to learn a bit about how RPGs and quest type systems are made and had a forming idea for a 2D style RPG and would note some key design ideas down for reference. I know that you should just forget about RPGs and basically any complicated game when starting out, and I still had my Horse Racing game to go back to as well, but there was a shortish course on Udemy that looked like it covered all the kind of things I’d love to know about like shops and inventories. I’d put it off for a while already but had to have a look at it.  For a little while I’d juggle the web dev course and this, where game dev things would tend to be on an evening, but not for as long as they had been in the past. I realised I also concentrated better in the mornings and able to take in things easier so did often struggle if I tried to do too much anyway on an evening. It was nice seeing a mini-RPG come together through the course and was definitely a challenge with some of the more intermediate programming concepts. Other than that, there wasn’t much else of note on the game dev scene apart from starting a bit from scratch again on the Horse Racing game with a more refactored approach and maybe dipping into Zombie farm. However, on the work side there was a lot more going on.</p>
    
    <h2>The Video</h2>
    <p>In the summer 2023 our Cross Platform prototype had gradually come on quite a bit with Mr Dude’s help, and we had the goal of presenting back the research and progress at a big work global Innovation event. Our mini project had been really great for again recapping how multiplayer technology can work using Photon engine, and how to work with external 3D assets and materials. We basically showed how you could have someone on desktop, and mobile devices with personalised avatars based on their football club preference and able to see live football scores. With the help of a video producer colleague, I was able to craft a video of our progress on our Unity demo and the work we’d done with 3rd parties and show off to the wider company at the innovation week. That was quite a proud moment as I was also put on a panel for the webinar to present it. It was also slightly sad though as it was evident we wouldn’t be able to continue with the project both due to the research results and a much bigger project coming up. I was glad though that I had started on with Web Development separately and had a mentor I would start having sessions with to take me along the journey as I got deeper into the course.</p>
    
    <h2>Mentoring and My Website Launch</h2>
    <p>Pretty much as soon as I started the course, I knew I’d want to get a mentor for help and guidance from someone experienced. One of my fellow colleagues, a senior software engineer who I’ll call Mr A (who I also knew from football and even padel) happily obliged and we put in some roughly fortnightly catch ups in. When I’d got through the HTML and CSS parts of the course, the first real big challenge was to create a portfolio. I went a bit above what was required, but did want to make it a lasting website where I could include not just web projects as I went along, but also my game dev stuff as well. Once it was created, we were then able to have some really good sessions talking through the code and making improvements. This was really valuable and started getting more used to using git, as generally when working on the game dev and work prototypes I’d been using Sourcetree to manage the source control. By now it was the end of October and had been able to craft the website which now has this dev blog. This was huge for me as finally I was able to share what I’d been able to do this last year and a bit just with putting one URL live. </p>
    
    <h2>Dev-ember</h2>
    <p>Looking back at my Udemy activity, November 2023 was the most productive month I had, clocking up nearly 15 hours of video tutorial. I had outlined a plan to work out what modules I’d likely to be able to complete each month so could work out a target end date for finishing the web dev course. I went quite ambitious (which would prove too ambitious) but was roughly hoping I would be finished for the following May 2024. I had a great start smashing through content covering JavaScript, DOM, and starting on back-end dev with Node. It was relatively easy to get going with JavaScript initially after having the C# background from game dev, though there would still be challenges getting used to the different syntax. Dev would drop off a bit in December, and only really managed to get through the Express module. Christmas was approaching and I was determined for us to have a much better one than the last and with my Sharesave scheme finally coming to an end it was nice timing to get a nice payout for Xmas presents. Around Black Friday I got very tempted to get a PS5 but decided to not rush and hold out for the slim version which was coming out just a day or two later.</p>
    
    <h2>The Console</h2>
    <p>How do you comfort a JavaScript bug? You console it.
    So, I was keen to ensure we had a great Xmas and as a kid for there was no better feeling than a big surprise gift and/or getting a new games console. I still remember when I got my first Master System II and that was at Christmas and came with Alex Kidd and Sonic. I got a SNES though a few years later which was just a generous purchase from my dad after a bit of nagging as my friend had one! A couple years after that though I went down the PC route and never really had quite that kind of magical moment again, except with games themselves. As I grew up I kind of just got myself consoles later on like the Wii, Wii U (don’t laugh), a 2nd hand XBOX 360, and later a Switch. I had never had a PlayStation though but had been tempted on occasion. It was definitely time. I liked the idea of being able to play more games with Jade and us having alternatives to TV on an evening when there wasn’t a Netflix box set we were fancying. Plus, the modern graphics would be great on the living room TV!
    In the end I bought as a surprise joint present a PS5, with Hogwarts Legacy, as we were both loved Harry Potter, and It Takes Two – A PS4 port designed game for couples with a story of 2 struggling parents going through a divorce, shrunk down to clay and ragdoll people. It seemed relatable going on where we were at the start of the year.
    After going a bit crazy and spending A LOT more than I normally would at Christmas we were all set up for a great Christmas and made some lovely birthday and family arrangements. But then we got COVID just a few days before. Luckily, it wasn’t too bad or long till we started feeling a bit better and getting negative results. It was exhausting getting everything sorted and presents wrapped but thoroughly enjoyed the surprise on Jades face when she opened her presents and the PS5, and we spent the day in pyjamas together playing the new games. We perked up enough to be able to then go to see her family for a few days then my family for a belated Xmas rounding off the year and giving a final treat for my sister and Jade in form of tickets for Abba Voyage later in the spring.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Happy Node Year</h2>
    <p>Why was the JavaScript developer sad? Because he didn't Node how to Express himself!</p>
    <p>The start of the year saw me continue with the course and getting more into Backend development and learning EJS including a project for a Blog Website. Work was getting really busy though so there wasn’t much extra learning time as there was a big deadline for a project coming up. Still feeling a little flush from the Sharesave returns though I did plan out some holidays. We couldn’t go anywhere till Jade’s leave renewed, but we wanted a nice little break away for Easter when it did so booked a hot tub lodge weekend in Lincolnshire. We had also been dying to go to Crete so booked that for June as our main holiday. Over X-mas though I had come across a festival called Rock Werchter in Belgium in July that had lots of good acts we really wanted to see and that ended being an impulse decision to do as well since Jade had never been to a camping festival. So, there were lots of nice things to look forward to suddenly. Even through work I used my learning fund to arrange to go to the WeAreDevelopers conference in July in Berlin as well. Once the craziness of my work project had finished, I was able to have a week off just myself, catch up with some house jobs, and managed to get in some good dev time and covered JSON and, API’s. I then had to do a project using a public API and decided on CATAPI – a site that just gave you random pictures (and gifs and captions) of Cats. That was a really fun one, and was quite proud how it turned out and ensured it went onto GitHub. Amazingly I can’t believe I haven’t mentioned the 2 cats we have already. We got 2 kitten brothers in lockdown back in 2020. A tabby called Gizzy and a ginger called Archie. They both have been going through the dev journey with me as well, keeping me company when working and devving from home. Gizzy in particular is often sat on my lap whilst I’m at my desk or trying to get attention and on occasion inadvertently writing some code. What’s also great is that our neighbour has a cat so we take turns feeding each other’s when we have holidays. I actually had an idea for an app /site to keep track of requested days and reminders as we currently just use What’s App. I’d like to give building that a go one day once done with the course and more confident.</p>

    <h2>Springing Forward</h2>
    
    <p>It was getting into Spring, and I started getting pretty productive with getting through the course, with new concepts that I’d never really learnt anything about previously like Databases. It’s not something that ever seemed that exciting to me, but then the dba’s I’d worked with didn’t seem excited by it either! By the way, don’t ask a DBA to help you move furniture. They’ve been known to drop tables…</p>
    <p>After a really nice easter break in Lincolnshire there was another course project to build a book review site to get into, using APIs to fetch book covers and a database to store it. I was reasonably proud of it once cracked it, though wasn’t something I would want to do for real as don’t read too much. With my learning fund I had bought a book on Unity for game dev, but not really used that much yet especially now focussed on web dev, and also bought a highly recommended book for developers called Clean Code. I did start that, but was maybe a bit beyond me at this stage to understand some of the code and concepts much beyond a very high level. Back to dev, it did seem like I got a bit of good routine going here but these few months weren’t easy. We had Jades mum staying with us quite a lot to be able to attend nearby medical appointments and treatment. Nevertheless, I did seem to chip away at the course either first thing on a morning or do a little at night, but mainly the mornings. Me and Jade had also taken up some Personal training at the gym to get a little more in shape for our summer hols meaning I’d have about 4 sessions week (some with a PT, some without) to work round my schedules.
    Next up on the course was Authentication and Authorisation, and really useful to get an insight to the different layers but was quite difficult to grasp the more advanced google cloud integrations. 
    However, the module was fairly short, and up next it was about to get into the really meaty end game subject which I really wanted to at least get a fair way into before the summer hols we had planned. REACT.</p>
    
    <h2>Monkeying Around</h2>
    <p>  Though focus for a while now had been web dev, I do still watch a fair few videos on you tube here and there on game dev. I find though you might not always be at a desk, it’s good to try cram in a bit of learning and advice where you can, so might often watch stuff over breakfast or lunch, or even in the bath occasionally. Some of my favourites are Sasquatch studios, Brackeys, Lost Relic Games, but for me Code Monkey really stands out. Earlier in the year he posted for free a Beginner C# course as a you tube video, with Intermediate and Advanced courses coming later. It’s basically his 10 years of knowledge put into the essential things to know. I watched the Beginner video and pleasingly it all made sense as was stuff I generally already knew, but it was nice to validate it and get the proper explanations and pick up a few tips. Then about a month after that, he released his Intermediate course. I planned for this to be my refresher and tool to help practice some of the concepts I’d been exploring now and then and help me implement into my game projects like the crazy horse racing, and a little RPG test scene I’d made to mainly just get more to grips with certain mechanics and concepts. A lot of that was generally parked, but was interesting to see the overview of what was “Intermediate” concepts, and definitely quite a bit for me to learn still there. I’d definitely recommend checking his page out if using Unity and C# as there is a treasure chest of videos on there.</p>
  
    
    <h2>Time to React</h2>
    
    <p>I was finally starting the react module and this was exciting as it was generally one of the main frameworks used at work. My goal was to be able grasp the basics through the course, so that I could start to understand how our websites hung together a bit, and try some hands-on practical experience eventually should I be able to get that opportunity. Getting access though on my windows laptop was not straightforward, taking many months off and on just to be able to get Git access and clone things to see some source code. This would still be a frustration months down the line but was comforting in some sense that other devs had same frustrations trying to get things running that I wanted to do as well. It was at least giving me more insight to actual tools used in the workplace and practical application of things I’d been learning about in my journey. 
    The react module started on the basics of components with the long-term goal of building a To Do App bit by bit. Overall, I was really liking it, though some challenges were a bit tricky. It was good that I was able to have mentoring sessions with Mr A, as he knew React well so we’d have some good stuff to review over the coming weeks.</p>
    
    <h2>It’s all Greek to Me</h2>
    <p>The time had finally come for our main holiday to Crete and to really kick off the summer so naturally would be a bit of a break from dev, work and home life. It was really needed, and timed quite well after Jade’s mum’s treatment had finished so could relax a bit. It was gorgeous weather, and did get a bit too hot almost for a couple of days but we did fortunately avoid the really bad heatwave that hit Greece just after we got back. I did take a book with me called F**k It - Do What You Love by John C Parkin, and managed to get through that just by finishing it on the plane on the way back. It was really motivating and inspiring, though at the same time when I returned to work it was a horrible state of reality to realise you don’t enjoy your current role anymore. It was also about this time that it was actually the 2-year marker since starting dev, and so wanted to start reflecting and documenting this even if it was just for me to look back on but did want to get this onto my site as a record. </p>
    
    <h2>Goals</h2>
     
    <p>When I came back from hols, I’d generally look to get my course done on a morning, and then in evenings try and write the odd chapter of my dev blog. I also set out some goals for the next 6 months to pretty much take me to the end of the year, partially inspired by the F*ck It book in terms of having some main focus goals.
    I scribbled down in a note book some bullet points of what I wanted to achieve split into 3 different areas but all underpinned by the same albeit very loose goal. BE A BETTER DEV.
    The 3 areas would be Web Dev, Game Dev, and Supporting. Below is what I’d scribbled. It was pretty ambitious, not all in my control with the work stuff, and I hadn’t defined how much “progress” I’d expect on the game dev side but I think they were good areas of focus to have.</p>
    
    <h4>Web Dev</h4>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Finish Course (<b>Top Priority</b>)</li>
        <li>Practical Work Experience
            <ul>
            <li>Run our sites locally</li>
            <li>Be taken through an example ticket</li>
            <li>Have a go at a ticket myself</li>
            <li>1 day a week doing dev</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Finish Fireship JavaScript Course (Hadn’t mentioned this but this is a very short bite-sized course Mr A recommended which I got with my learning fund and is still in progress)</li>
        </ul></p>

    <h4>Game Dev</h4>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Experiment with RPG Scene (like getting more used to concepts like Inheritance for interactable objects such as chopping a tree for wood)</li>
        <li>Spent time on Code Monkey Videos (in particular the intermediate video)</li>
        <li>Progress my Crazy Horse Racing game</li>
        <li>Progress Zombie Farm</li>
    </ul>
   </p>
    <h4>Supporting</h4>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Write my 2-year dev blog</li>
        <li>Write a typical day (wanted this on my portfolio About me section)</li>
        <li>Update my linked in profile (really want this to start showcasing more my skills I’ve been picking up and make it more tech focussed)</li>
        <li>Touch typing course (I thought this would be a good way to improve efficiency not just in programming but day to day work as well)</li>
    </ul></p>

    <h2>Euro Trip Part 1 – Football Festival</h2>
    <p>With Crete over I had a few weeks to focus back on some dev before a very jam-packed July. I love June as the whole summer is still ahead of you, the weather gets better and it was also the start of Euro’s. I had an extra keen hope for England to do well, as I had planned to go to Berlin early to be there for the final before the We Are Developers conference began a few days later. Being favourites, and having a lot of talent in the squad I thought there would be a chance. I made some progress on the React course which was a very big module. A few weeks later it was almost time for another trip away but not quite time for Berlin yet. Thanks to Jude Bellingham’s overhead kick though England limped into the Quarter finals after not much of a convincing tournament display so far. The next trip before that was Belgium and the Rock Werchter festival. Me and Jade were proper excited for this trip, maybe not so much the carrying of camping bags, through airports, trains and buses, and wasn’t ideal timing at all that I twisted my ankle that week playing football. It was worth it though. We had a great time in really nice camping accommodation that had a proper fun party atmosphere, and saw the likes of Avril Lavigne, Sum41, Snow Patrol, Foo Fighters, The Kooks, and Jade’s favourite artist Dua Lipa. After 4 days of it though we were ready for home, as not sure our feet, livers or bank accounts could handle much more. Not going home just yet though was England who we watched go through on pens on our phone whilst waiting in the toilet queue at the festival.</p>
    
    <h2>Euro Trip Part 2 – Berlin</h2>

    <p>I think I had about 6 days at home to do a couple of work shifts before I was back on the plane, and can’t even remember if I did much on my course during that time but think I chipped away a little at React. Before I went though there was the matter of an exciting Dutch Semi. Still recovering from Belgium, we found ourselves having a drink at the local to watch England, and thanks to Ollie Watkins late glorious winner it meant I now got to experience an England Final in Berlin against Spain. I didn’t have a match ticket but would kick off my stay there and experience the fan park.  It was an absolutely brilliant experience, with about 10 to 1 England fans in the park and hearing unforgettable gems like “You’re sh*t, but your birds are fit”, and “You can shove your f*ck*ng tapas up your ar**”. All in good jest mind. Turns out though we were actually the sh*t team and Spain went on to deservedly win. After a few days exploring the city solo it was finally time for the conference, meet up with some other work colleagues and to get concentrating on a world of dev.</p>
    <p>The conference was huge, it was a 2-day event that had about 20 stages, loads of stalls and exhibitions. With still being quite junior in my dev journey I tried to focus on the more high-level talks, and there was a definite theme across many talks this year-round A.I, but there were some really good talks with some big leaders from companies like GitHub, Stack Overflow, the inventor of JSON, and an inspiring talk from Marco Landi who recruited Steve Jobs at Apple. Unfortunately, due to the CrowdStrike issue which took down several networks and Windows machines worldwide he wasn’t able to fly to the conference so had to deliver the talk remotely. Otherwise, the conference went smoothly and was a brilliant experience that only made me more motivated to continue my journey and would soon book next years when returned as we had a 20% off code!</p>
    <h2>Euro Trip Part 3 – Krakow, Cluj …and Crypto</h2>
    
    <p>Being back home again, I was actually starting to be glad to get a bit of routine going again. Catching up with work, getting back into the swing of gym, and progressing with the React module would be the idea of the next few weeks. However, mine and Jade’s 5-year anniversary was coming up so I had one more treat of the holiday season to come and we had lined up, a bit last minute mind, a weekend trip to Krakow to round off July. It was lovely city and time away, but definitely had it’s sombre and thought-provoking moments with doing the Auschwitz tour, and triggered a bit more cultural learning at home when back through a few shows/films. Nevertheless a few weeks later thanks to a few mornings on my course I had finally finished the React module, and seen how a To Do List app was put together. It didn’t cover how it would be hosted or keep the data up and running though, something I’d be keen to implement later on, but oddly the next module would cover that off under quite a different theme – Web 3.0 and Crypto Tokens. I wasn’t too interested in learning about the Web 3.0 stuff which covers blockchains, and Internet Computer but I did want to finish the course and the last few modules still did use React so I kept at it. However, it was a big struggle, as the course was quite out of date and there were lots of issues running things with package dependencies. I muddled through though but can’t say I was grasping the new language “Motoko” too well. August was a bit hectic but battled through the course, we had some unfortunate family things to deal with, and then Jade pulled her back really bad on bank holiday weekend a couple of weeks before her girls’ holiday to Tenerife. Luckily it recovered just enough in time so she could go. I also had at the same time a work trip to Cluj, Romania for a first-time trip to one of our other offices. It was good event and gave more food for thought around using AI more, and had some good connections and conversations about career progression and possibly looking at shadowing.
    </p>
    
    <h2>The End of the Beginning?</h2>
    
    <p>I can’t say my routine had been brilliant lately, Jade’s holiday and her back injury threw things off a little, as I found it little more difficult to get up early! A further setback of it flaring up meant she had another week off work after only being back there a few days. I’d also started playing quite a bit of Zelda Tears of The Kingdom on the Switch, so evenings generally would be just chilling watching TV with Jade, maybe a little of It Takes Two on the PS5 we were still slowly going through, or playing a bit of Zelda. However I was on the final stretch with the course, which was around an NFT marketplace for buying and selling digital art, and had squeezed in some mornings and bits on weekends which were starting be a little quieter than they were in the summer. This was a really complex project and got quite stuck in the final video despite searching through the Q&A and trying a few things meaning I couldn’t see it fully working as intended on my end. A common thing I heard in the course is that the struggle is part of programming and how you learn, and definitely felt that in these Crypto modules. Some things I’d be able to sort and get working but I didn’t want to spend further time on this as I had other things I was keen to get onto. I did the rest of the video the best I could and finally, finally on an autumnal feeling Sunday, 29th Sept 2024, the course was 100% complete and had my certificate! 16 months after starting out on I now had foundational knowledge and skills to start building my own websites, and not limited to just front end, but incorporating back end too. It was an exciting and proud moment yet I still felt I had loads left to practice and learn or relearn with some concepts now being a little while ago since I’d touched them.</p>
    <p>I needed to review and revamp my goals as this had dragged out a bit, but had 3 months left of the year. I basically wanted to get more practice and build more things myself from scratch so I could build up my portfolio. This aligned with advice from my mentor Mr A and also another engineer I’d also been chatting to who I was also going to seek further help around my work dev exposure. This would mean I’d need to still put my Game Dev on the back burner and hadn’t really progressed anything on that.
    So, what next in terms of projects I’d like to better show on my Portfolio? 
    
    <ol>
        <li>Build a To Do App from scratch at least with a database, and ideally auth.</li>
        <li>Build A Blog Website properly from scratch so I could upload this and keep it going.</li>
        <li>Build FeedMyCat site/app that for help with tracking holidays/weekends away with neighbours. This would be a great more personal project that would stand out from the standard ones.</li>
    </ol>
    To do and complement possibly all of the above I’d want to look into:
    <ul>
        <li>Researching Firebase as a hosting tool with authentication and databases included.</li>
        <li>Finishing JavaScript fireship bitesize course.</li>
    </ul>
    They would be my primary goals/focus. In the background though I also wanted to:
    <ul>
        <li>At least upload my dev blog to my current static Portfolio.</li>
        <li>Schedule time for the touch-typing course (hadn’t done anything more on this)</li>
        <li>Get further with dev at work as still have connectivity issues getting access.</li>
        <li>Update my LinkedIn with my new skills</li>
    </ul></p>
    
    <p>If I could get most of the above achieved by the end of the year, I’d be happy and feel like I’d be in a place going into 2025 where I would have more opportunities and transitioning to a software developer could become a tangible prospect. The money may still be an issue, but I could at least be skilled enough to do something, and maybe even start earning some little bits on the side by starting small with some freelance tasks and side hustles to help with building up more skills more.</p>  
    <p>Talking about side hustles, I also wasn’t the only one looking to propel forwards onto new things. Jade had been struggling with her career goals and motivation and had been looking at getting into an online travel group on the side. It could start with just earning commission and holidays we book for ourselves and friends but had the opportunity to really grow into something. She signed up to it this weekend. Other potentially life changing events were coming up for us as well as we were starting fertility treatment in the next month, which initially just stemmed from curiosity and concerns if we could have kids. (Fortunately, nothing indicated we couldn’t yet) No doubt there will be other challenges ahead, but feel like we are both in a good place, with a specific focus now to change things and do what we love and a bit of time before Christmas to implement. Hopefully physically there will be no more injuries, enabling a healthy fitness routine. I’ve kept the gym up very well, back to football tomorrow, and the new Leeds Padel Courts opens in 2 weeks. Jade is resuming her recent walk/bus method for work and hope the physio will see her being able to resume her gym personal training again soon. Reflecting on it all, as I’ve finished my course and writing this blog up to this point on the exact same day I think this is truly now the end of the beginning of my journey, and like so many times when talking about exercise, diets, and other goals, it really starts properly Monday!</p>
    
    <h2>Bonus Tips</h2>

    <p>If In case you’re reading this because also relate to needing a change or are also in the world of dev I’ll leave a few generic tips I’ve picked up on the way that I’m not necessarily great at sticking to.
    <ul>
        <li>Do less of what you hate, and more what you love</li>
        <li>Think about what you need to do, to enable you to do more what you love and have clear goals. (This may be not always be perfect or even enjoyable.)</li>
        <li>Find your peak brain time for efficiency and plan around that -e.g. I do find I am more alert and productive when it comes to learning and dev in the morning before starting the day job so try schedule your time for then and make it a routine.</li>
        <li>Find a balance – still enjoy life, make time for loved ones and it’s good to switch off too.</li>
        <li>Stay fit, it does give you more energy. </li>
        <li>Don’t try and do it solo, seek others out for help, advice, mentoring.</li>
        <li>Make sure if you are learning, to not get stuck in “tutorial hell”, practice doing things yourself. </li>
        <li>Phones are a such time sink, try uninstall apps like facebook or at least move the icon from the home screen if it becomes too habitual to grab your phone and mindlessly scroll. Block notifications when you want to focus. (But share that funny cat video first)</li>
        <li>Keep re-evaluating your goals, things change but you’ve got this!</li>
    </ul>
